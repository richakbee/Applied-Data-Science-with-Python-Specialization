# Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python

## Week 1: Fundamentals of Data Manipulation with Python
 an introduction to the field of data science, review common Python functionality and features which data scientists use
 
- Python Functions
- Python Types and Sequences
- Python More on Strings
- Python Demonstration: Reading and Writing CSV files
- Python Dates and Times
- Advanced Python Objects, map()
- Advanced Python Lambda and List Comprehensions
- Numerical Python Library (NumPy)
- Manipulating Text with Regular Expression

## Week 2:Basic Data Processing with Pandas
learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkits Python has for data cleaning and processing -- pandas. You'll learn how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed.

- Introduction to Pandas
- The Series Data Structure
- Querying a Series
- DataFrame Data Structure
- DataFrame Indexing and Loading
- Querying a DataFrame
- Indexing Dataframes
- Missing Values
- Example: Manipulating DataFrame

## Week 3:More Data Processing with Pandas
deepen your understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. We'll also refresh your understanding of scales of data, and discuss issues with creating metrics for analysis.

- Merging Dataframes
- Pandas Idioms
- Group by
- Scales
- Pivot Table
- Date/Time Functionality
