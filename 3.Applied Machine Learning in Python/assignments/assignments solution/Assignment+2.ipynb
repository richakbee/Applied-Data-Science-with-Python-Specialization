    "\n",
    "For this question, we're going to use the `validation_curve` function in `sklearn.model_selection` to determine training and test scores for a Support Vector Classifier (`SVC`) with varying parameter values.  Recall that the validation_curve function, in addition to taking an initialized unfitted classifier object, takes a dataset as input and does its own internal train-test splits to compute results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because creating a validation curve requires fitting multiple models, for performance reasons this question will use just a subset of the original mushroom dataset: please use the variables X_subset and y_subset as input to the validation curve function (instead of X_mush and y_mush) to reduce computation time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialized unfitted classifier object we'll be using is a Support Vector Classifier with radial basis kernel.  So your first step is to create an `SVC` object with default parameters (i.e. `kernel='rbf', C=1`) and `random_state=0`. Recall that the kernel width of the RBF kernel is controlled using the `gamma` parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this classifier, and the dataset in X_subset, y_subset, explore the effect of `gamma` on classifier accuracy by using the `validation_curve` function to find the training and test scores for 6 values of `gamma` from `0.0001` to `10` (i.e. `np.logspace(-4,1,6)`). Recall that you can specify what scoring metric you want validation_curve to use by setting the \"scoring\" parameter.  In this case, we want to use \"accuracy\" as the scoring metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each level of `gamma`, `validation_curve` will fit 3 models on different subsets of the data, returning two 6x3 (6 levels of gamma x 3 fits per level) arrays of the scores for the training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the mean score across the three models for each level of `gamma` for both arrays, creating two arrays of length 6, and return a tuple with the two arrays.\n",
